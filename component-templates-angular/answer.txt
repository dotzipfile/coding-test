This HTML template provides a navigation menu representing each of the objects in the settingsMenu array.

Within the <nav> tags the <a> link will be repeated for every object in the settingsMenu array 
and will use the route element in each object to link to the specified views in the Routes array.

The routerLinkActive attribute will determine how each link is styled depending on whether it is active or not.

The <router-outlet> provides a place for the specified view to be rendered.
